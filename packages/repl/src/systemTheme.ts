/**
 * Terminal dark/light mode detection for the 'auto' theme setting.
 *
 * Detection is based on the terminal's actual background color (queried via
 * OSC 11 by systemThemeWatcher.ts) rather than the OS appearance setting —
 * a dark terminal on a light-mode OS should still resolve to 'dark'.
 *
 * The detected theme is cached module-level so callers can resolve 'auto'
 * without awaiting the async OSC round-trip. The cache is seeded from
 * $COLORFGBG (synchronous, set by some terminals at launch) and then
 * updated by the watcher once the OSC 11 response arrives.
