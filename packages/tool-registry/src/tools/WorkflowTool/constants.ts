export const WORKFLOW_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Execute a workflow script that orchestrates multiple subagents deterministically. Workflows run in the background — this tool returns immediately with a task ID, and a <task-notification> arrives when the workflow completes. Use /workflows to watch live progress.

A workflow structures work across many agents — to be comprehensive (decompose and cover in parallel), to be confident (independent perspectives and adversarial checks before committing), or to take on scale one context can't hold (migrations, audits, broad sweeps). The script is where you encode that structure: what fans out, what verifies, what synthesizes.

ONLY call this tool when the user has explicitly opted into multi-agent orchestration. Workflows can spawn dozens of agents and consume a large amount of tokens; the user must request that scale, not have it inferred. Explicit opt-in means one of:
- The user included the "ultrawork" keyword (you'll see a system-reminder confirming it).
- The user directly asked you to run a workflow or use multi-agent orchestration in their own words ("run a workflow", "fan out agents", "orchestrate this with subagents"). The ask must be in the user's words — a task that would merely benefit from a workflow does not count.
- The user invoked a skill or slash command whose instructions tell you to call Workflow.
- The user asked you to run a specific named or saved workflow.

For any other task — even one that would clearly benefit from parallelism — do NOT call this tool. Use the Agent tool for individual subagents, or briefly describe what a multi-agent workflow could do and how much it would roughly cost, and ask the user whether to run it. Mention they can include "ultrawork" in a future message to skip the ask.

When you do call it, the right move is often **hybrid**: scout inline first (list the files, find the channels, scope the diff) to discover the work-list, then call Workflow to pipeline over it. You don't need to know the shape before the *task* — only before the *orchestration step*.

Every invocation persists its script to a file under the session directory and returns the path in the tool result. To iterate on a workflow, edit that file with Write/Edit and re-invoke Workflow with \`{scriptPath: "<path>"}\` instead of resending the full script.

Every script must begin with \`export const meta = {...}\`:
  export const meta = {
    name: 'find-flaky-tests',
    description: 'Find flaky tests and propose fixes',   // one-line, shown in permission dialog
    phases: [                                            // one entry per phase() call
      { title: 'Scan', detail: 'grep test logs for retries' },
      { title: 'Fix', detail: 'one agent per flaky test' },
    ],
  }
  // script body starts here — use agent()/parallel()/pipeline()/phase()/log()
  phase('Scan')
  const flaky = await agent('grep CI logs for retry markers', {schema: FLAKY_SCHEMA})
  ...

The \`meta\` object must be a PURE LITERAL — no variables, function calls, spreads, or template interpolation. Required fields: \`name\`, \`description\`. Optional: \`whenToUse\` (shown in the workflow list), \`phases\`. Use the SAME phase titles in meta.phases as in phase() calls — titles are matched exactly; a phase() call with no matching meta entry just gets its own progress group. Add \`model\` to a phase entry when that phase uses a specific model override (e.g. \`{title: 'Verify', model: 'haiku'}\`).

Script body hooks:
- agent(prompt: string, opts?: {label?: string, phase?: string, schema?: object, model?: string, isolation?: 'worktree', agentType?: string}): Promise<any> — spawn a subagent. Without schema, returns its final text as a string. With schema (a JSON Schema), the subagent is forced to call a StructuredOutput tool and agent() returns the validated object — no parsing needed. Returns null if the user skips the agent mid-run (filter with .filter(Boolean)). opts.label overrides the display label. opts.phase explicitly assigns this agent to a progress group (use this inside pipeline()/parallel() stages to avoid races on the global phase() state — same phase string → same group box). opts.model overrides the model for this agent call — omit to inherit the main loop model (preferred, unless the user specifies a model or the task is simple enough for 'haiku'). opts.isolation: 'worktree' runs the agent in a fresh git worktree — EXPENSIVE, use ONLY when agents mutate files in parallel and would otherwise conflict. opts.agentType uses a custom subagent type (e.g. 'Explore', 'code-reviewer') instead of the default workflow subagent — resolved from the same registry as the Agent tool; composes with schema.
- pipeline(items, stage1, stage2, ...): Promise<any[]> — run each item through all stages independently, NO barrier between stages. Item A can be in stage 3 while item B is still in stage 1. This is the DEFAULT for multi-stage work. Every stage callback receives (prevResult, originalItem, index). A stage that throws drops that item to \`null\` and skips its remaining stages.
- parallel(thunks: Array<() => Promise<any>>): Promise<any[]> — run tasks concurrently. This is a BARRIER: awaits all thunks before returning. A thunk that throws (or whose agent errors) resolves to \`null\` in the result array — the call itself never rejects, so \`.filter(Boolean)\` before using the results. Use ONLY when you genuinely need all results together.
- log(message: string): void — emit a progress message to the user (shown as a narrator line above the progress tree)
- phase(title: string): void — start a new phase; subsequent agent() calls are grouped under this title in the progress display
- args: any — the value passed as Workflow's \`args\` input (undefined if not provided). Use this to parameterize named workflows.
- budget: {total: number|null, spent(): number, remaining(): number} — the turn's token target from the user's "+500k"-style directive. \`budget.total\` is null if no target was set. The target is a HARD ceiling: once \`spent()\` reaches \`total\`, further \`agent()\` calls throw. Use for dynamic loops: \`while (budget.total && budget.remaining() > 50_000) { ... }\`.
- workflow(nameOrRef: string | {scriptPath: string}, args?: any): Promise<any> — run another workflow inline as a sub-step. Nesting is one level only: workflow() inside a child throws.

Subagents are told their final text IS the return value (not a human-facing message), so they return raw data. For structured output, use the schema option — validation happens at the tool-call layer so the model retries on mismatch.

The script body runs in an async context — use await directly. Standard JS built-ins (JSON, Math, Array, etc.) are available — EXCEPT \`Date.now()\`/\`Math.random()\`/argless \`new Date()\`, which throw (they would break resume); pass timestamps in via \`args\`, stamp results after the workflow returns, and for randomness vary the agent prompt/label by index. No filesystem or Node.js API access.

DEFAULT TO pipeline(). Only reach for a barrier (parallel between stages) when you genuinely need ALL prior-stage results together.

Total agent count across a workflow's lifetime is capped at 1000 — a runaway-loop backstop set far above any real workflow.

## Resume

The tool result includes a runId. To resume after a pause, kill, or script edit, relaunch with Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId}) — the longest unchanged prefix of agent() calls returns cached results instantly; the first edited/new call and everything after it runs live. Same script + same args → 100% cache hit. Date.now()/Math.random()/new Date() are unavailable in scripts (they would break this) — stamp results after the workflow returns, or pass timestamps via args.`
